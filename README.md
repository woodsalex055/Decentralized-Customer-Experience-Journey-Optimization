### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/decentralized-cx-journey-optimization.git
   cd decentralized-cx-journey-optimization
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Run tests:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm test
   \`\`\`

### Deployment

Deploy contracts to Stacks blockchain:

\`\`\`bash
# Deploy verification contract first
clarinet deploy contracts/experience-designer-verification.clar

# Deploy other contracts in order
clarinet deploy contracts/journey-mapping.clar
clarinet deploy contracts/touchpoint-optimization.clar
clarinet deploy contracts/friction-reduction.clar
clarinet deploy contracts/satisfaction-measurement.clar
\`\`\`

## Usage Examples

### 1. Verify an Experience Designer

\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .experience-designer-verification verify-designer

"Awareness"
"Customer discovers the product"
(list "social-media" "search-engine" "advertising")
(list "curious" "interested")

(list "personalized-content" "clear-messaging"))
\`\`\`

### 4. Optimize a Touchpoint

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test suites using Vitest:

\`\`\`bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
\`\`\`

Test files are located in the \`tests/\` directory:
- \`experience-designer-verification.test.ts\`
- \`journey-mapping.test.ts\`
- \`touchpoint-optimization.test.ts\`
- \`friction-reduction.test.ts\`
- \`satisfaction-measurement.test.ts\`

## Security Considerations

- All contracts implement proper authorization checks
- Designer verification is required for most operations
- Data integrity is maintained through contract validation
- Block height is used for timestamping (using \`stacks-block-height\`)
